# Form3-API-Guides - Drafts
This is the drafts branch for the HowTo Guides for the Form3 Financial Cloud API.

Note the following things:

- Since Markdown doesn't support comments or colored text, I've marked internal comments in ***bold italics***. I'm not sure if this is the best way, feel free to suggest something better.
- The finished guide should enable readers to follow along and execute the steps as they read. Should we provide the example code in multiple languages, e.g. RAW, Python, etc.?
- I've formatted the guide assuming Slate will be used to display it. If that is not the case, the position of the code examples should be adjusted to not always be at the top.
